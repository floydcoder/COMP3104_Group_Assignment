Plan:DevOps teams should adopt agile practices to improve speed and quality. 
 Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps 
 teams break work into smaller pieces to deliver incremental value.

Build: Git is a free and open source version control system. It offers excellent support for
 branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative
 and powerful workflows and tools for the development build process.

Continuous Integration And Delivery: CI/CD allows teams to release quality products 
 frequently and predictably, from source code repository to production with automated 
 workflows. Teams can merge code changes frequently, deploy feature flags, and incorporate
 end-to-end testing.
