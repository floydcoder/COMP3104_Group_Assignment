SDLC in DevOps

Accordind to Atlassian.com thius are the definition of each step in the DevOps SDLC

Plan:DevOps teams should adopt agile practices to improve speed and quality. 
 Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps 
 teams break work into smaller pieces to deliver incremental value.

Build: Git is a free and open source version control system. It offers excellent support for
 branching, merging, and rewriting repository history, which has led to many innovative
 and powerful workflows and tools for the development build process.

Continuous Integration And Delivery: CI/CD allows teams to release quality products 
 frequently and predictably, from source code repository to production with automated 
 workflows. Teams can merge code changes frequently, deploy feature flags, and incorporate
 end-to-end testing.

Monitor and Alert: Quickly identify and resolve issues that impact product uptime, 
 speed, and functionality. Automatically notify your team of changes, high-risk actions, or 
 failures, so you can keep services on.

Operate: Manage the end-to-end delivery of IT services to customers. This includes the
 practices involved in design, implementation, configuration, deployment, and 
 maintenance of all IT infrastructure that supports an organizationâ€™s services.

Continuous Feedback: DevOps teams should evaluate each release and generate reports to
 improve future releases. By gathering continuous feedback, teams
 can improve their processes and incorporate customer feedback to improve the next release.
