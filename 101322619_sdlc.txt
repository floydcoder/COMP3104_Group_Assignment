1. Shorten Production Cycles: Siloed development and operations teams 
extend the production cycle unnecessarily. It becomes harder for both 
teams to collaborate on the processes required to get the software 
operational. Close collaboration through the elimination of silos speeds 
up innovation and development. 
2. Increase Deployment Success Rates 
Programming errors is one of the leading reasons why a deployment fails. 
The frequent release of code occasioned with the DevOps approach ensures 
problem detection at an earlier stage. With dev and ops teams working 
together, recovery time is a lot shorter.
